CityScript
==========

This is a Cakescript G2-based roleplaying gamemode for Garry's Mod 13

Think of it as a lightweight alternative to DarkRP.

This gamemode not based on DarkRP code - it is based on Cakescript G2.

There is a small amount of code here from both DarkRP and SeriousRP

You can use this project to form a base for your RP community if you like.


Installation
____________

1) The folder "cityscript" goes into "garrysmod/gamemodes" on your server.

2) Create a content collection for your server. It must include at least
   the following addons:

   - CSS Weapons on M9K Base (108720350)
   - M9K Assault Rifles (128089118)
   - M9K Small Arms Pack (128093075)
   - M9K Heavy Weapons (128091208)
   - M9K Specialities (144982052)
   - Nuke (106565409)

3) You must provide the id of your workshop collection on the dedicated server command line when starting your server. You can do this using +host_workshop_collection id (where 'id' is the ID of your workshop collection).

Note: If you do not include the addons above, what will happen is not defined (since it's not meant to be played that way). You will at the very least, experience Lua errors during gameplay and missing functionality.
