This is the TODO list for CityScript.

It contains things I plan to add or change.
I keep it inside the git repo so I don't lose it.
This list is for my own reference.
Some of these things might not make sense to you.
I probably won't implement everything you see here
at any one moment.

================================================================================

- CSS Realistic Weapons
	- Ensure weapon give works on pickup
		- XM1014 doesn't work (weapon_xm1014)
		
	- Ensure addon download is triggered
- Remember active tab index
- Tile Images for Weapons
- Roleplaying Vehicles Addon (or find another)
- Fix player animations / models
	- Fix character selection.
		- Make it so that any "non-special-class" player can be chosen when creating a new character.
		- Player can have a maximum of 5 characters. They need to delete one to create one after that.
		- When a player changes to another team, change the model as appropriate but keep the old one
		  in case they change that team back again
		- Persist the team change per character to the character in the list
		- Drop the concept of having a title
	- On death:
		- Reset active tab index
		- Clicking brings up the character list for selecting a character and pre-selects the first.
